## Bird-lg Extended

Yet another alternative implementation of the [bird-lg](https://github.com/sileht/bird-lg) and [bird-lg-go](https://github.com/xddxdd/bird-lg-go) frontend.

This project is using Next.js to provide a more modern and flexible frontend experience, with support for real-time streaming (if the backend actually supports it).

In the future, this project will also support more features that are not available and not possible in the original proxy API implementations, by using a companion backend server, or a fork of the Go backend/proxy.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is in WIP state, and may not be suitable for production use yet.
